A huge shoutout to UnslothAI for their incredible efforts! Thanks to their hard work, we can now run the full DeepSeek-R1 671B parameter model in its dynamic 1.58-bit quantized form (compressed to just 131GB) on Llama.cpp! And the best part? You no longer have to despair about needing massive enterprise-class GPUs or servers — it’s possible to run this model on your personal machine (albeit slowly for most consumer hardware).
